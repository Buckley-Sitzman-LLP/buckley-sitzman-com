# Buckley Sitzman - Site

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. `yarn install` in root
3. `yarn start` to bring up dev server
4. Open `http://localhost:8080`

This site deploys automatically upon push to `main` branch on GitHub.

Any build issues will show up in the `yarn start` terminal window. The tooling
automatically looks for things like missing closing tags in HTML, syntax issues
in JS or CSS, and so on.
