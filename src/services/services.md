  - title: Product Development
    body: You've got a product you need built. We can build it for you, using the
      best of modern software development tools and practices. We've brought
      dozens of products to market successfully, and can help you do the same.
  - title: Web Applications
    body: We use **Ruby**, **Elixir** and **Javascript** (including React, Vue, and
      Alpine) to build robust and performant web applications that can grow and
      change with your business.
  - title: Data Security
    body: We have experience working in very regulated environments where compliance
      with security practices is important. We'll help keep your data safe.
  - title: Online Payments
    body: The world is moving to e-commerce. Our experience building payment
      gateways will let us help you accept online payments securely and safely,
      knowing you'll be fully PCI-compliant.
  - title: Application Wrangling
    body: Your code is out of control! New feature development has slowed to a
      crawl. Bugs abound. We can get your codebase back under control and help
      your team be happier and more productive.
  - title: Training and Mentorship
    body: In our previous lives, Ryan and Andrew were both teachers. We can bring
      that experience along with our technical expertise to training up your
      staff, especially if you have a relatively new team.
  - title: Product Validation
    body: You have an idea, but you're not sure yet if you should build it, much
      less how. We can help you make those determinations before a single line
      of code is written.
  - title: High Fives
    body: We're really good at high fives. Like, *really* good. Lately it's been air
      fives, and we're good at those too.
